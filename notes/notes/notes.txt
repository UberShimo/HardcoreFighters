Debug tips:
Is hitbox collision Automatic per Frame?
Is hurtbox collision Manual per Frame?
All pressed buttons work with buffer numbers. Gotta use if(a_pressed > 0) to check the input.
cancel eff works when things goes in this order:
1. Set sprite
2. Subtract from cancels
3. Spawn cancel eff
4. Set recover alarm etc...

Notes in notes:
Hurtbox = sprite collision
Attack collision = purple sprites
We are not using particles since we cant manipulate it good enough. Slow mo, scaling per dmg etc...

Battle system:
Hitting an attack makes you able to cancel attack earlier with another actions.
Works 2 times / combo. Combo wont reset in air and air dashes consume cancels.
If you press down when hitting attack in air you will launch down making it easier to continue combo on ground.
First cancel blink orange and second cancel blinks red meaning no more combo.
You have meter that fills up to 4 bars.
Build meter by: Moving toward opponent, hitting opponent (on block also), getting hit without blocking.
You block with RT and LT.
Low attacks hit standing blockers.
High attacks hit crouching blockers.

Some moves are cancelable meaning you can cancel them without hitting opponent and
some are are final meaning it will finish you combo instantly.


F:				Fast short attack.
F + down:		Fast low attack.
F + air:		Fast air attack.

L:				Fast long attack with longer recovery.
L + down:		Anti air attack.
L + air:		Bigger air attack.

S:				Strong but slow attack.
S + down:		Launcher.
S + air:		Spike attack.

Circle movements + attack: Special moves

v,> S:			20 frames high grounded attack.
v,< S:			20 frames Sweeping low attack.

X:				Meter moves that costs meter.
<,v,> X:		Ultra move. Cost 100% meter.
X + Dash:		Force dash. Can be used in bad situations but ends combo and cost 25% meter.

Character ideas:

Dash slightly upward.
Summon an arrow from above at any time.
X = teleport above, behind enemy.
X = Create gravity field. (heavier or lighter)

Batman{
	X = Super ball. Bounce alot and lasts for long.
}

Speed man{
	<v>X = slow game down to 20% for enemies.
}

Great sword{
	v>F: Spin forward blocking high and low. Follow up with F, L or S
