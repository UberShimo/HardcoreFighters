TODO{
	Move BG/Music/Layout settings to character select
	Change the ULTRA input maybe. So it is easier to do.
	Make game look sexy, balanced and fun
	Frame rate drops for some reason at times?
	Is extra freeze frames broken on block? Donnu.
	Make Adventure mode
}

Debug tips:
Is hitbox mask same as sprite?
Is hitbox collision Automatic per Frame?
Is hurtbox collision Manual per Frame?
All pressed buttons work with buffer numbers. Gotta use if(a_pressed > 0) to check the input.
Keep an eye out for reset_buffers(), reset_physics().
cancel eff works when things goes in this order:
1. Set sprite
2. Subtract from cancels
3. Spawn cancel eff
4. Set recover alarm etc...
When checking attack input it has to get checked in this order:
1. Air moves
2. Half circle moves
3. Quarter circle moves
4. Normal ground moves

Notes in notes:
"This Is Standard Naming"
Action infos ends with a "."
Hurtbox = sprite collision
Attack collision = purple sprites
We are not using particles since we cant manipulate it good enough. Slow mo, scaling per dmg etc...
Dont fuck with image angle on attacks...


Character stuff:

Balanced:	Batman, Katana
Power:		Boomhand, Greatsword
Agility:	Claws, Baller
Zoner:		Bow, Mage

MOVES!:

Batman{
	
}

Katana{
	
}

Claws{
	Flurry looks underwhelming.
}

Baller{
	
}

Bow{
	
}

Greatsword{
	
}

Boomhand{
	ULTRA should look cooler on startup.
	2L > BackstepBOOM doesnt quite work for some reason.
	Groundsmash hit effect sounds bad.
	Groundsmash leave DoT on ground.
}

Cultist{
	Teleport effect could be sexier.
}
