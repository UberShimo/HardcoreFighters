TODO{
	Add all 8 start characters
	Rename actions like "426S" to "high" so it is more humane. "This Is Standard Naming"
	Make some attacks into hit_effect instead.
	Check all attacks initiators and see so it works correctly.
	Make all hitboxes have correct startup/recovery info.
	Respawn works bad. You can fly like hell. Hit opponent. Shitty stuff!
	Fix character sprite size so it matches the size of the actual sprites. Then fix collision boxes ofc.
	Fix actual menus
	Fix so you can see character attacks n combos
	Add sound n music
	Make cool death effect/scene
	Make game look sexy, balanced and fun
	
	Push :: Execution Error - Variable Index [8] out of range [8] - -1.players(100244,8)
 at gml_Script_anon_gml_Object_Obj_Match_Manager_Create_0_159_gml_Object_Obj_Match_Manager_Create_0 (line 18) - players[j] = players[j+1];
}

Debug tips:
Is hitbox mask same as sprite?
Is hitbox collision Automatic per Frame?
Is hurtbox collision Manual per Frame?
All pressed buttons work with buffer numbers. Gotta use if(a_pressed > 0) to check the input.
Keep an eye out for reset_buffers(), reset_physics().
cancel eff works when things goes in this order:
1. Set sprite
2. Subtract from cancels
3. Spawn cancel eff
4. Set recover alarm etc...
When checking attack input it has to get checked in this order:
1. Air moves
2. Half circle moves
3. Quarter circle moves
4. Normal ground moves

Notes in notes:
"This Is Standard Naming"
Hurtbox = sprite collision
Attack collision = purple sprites
We are not using particles since we cant manipulate it good enough. Slow mo, scaling per dmg etc...
Dont fuck with image angle on attacks...

Battle system:
Hitting an attack makes you able to cancel attack earlier with another actions.
Works 2 times / combo. Combo wont reset in air and air dashes consume cancels.
If you press down when hitting attack in air you will launch down making it easier to continue combo on ground.
First cancel blink orange and second cancel blinks red meaning no more combo.
You have meter that fills up to 4 bars.
Build meter by: Moving toward opponent, hitting opponent (on block also), getting hit without blocking.
You block with RT and LT.
RT and LT also makes you unable to cancel if you want to not cancel a move.
Low attacks hit standing blockers.
High attacks hit crouching blockers.

Some moves are cancelable meaning you can cancel them without hitting opponent and
some are are final meaning it will finish you combo instantly.

F = FAST
F:				Fast short attack.
F + down:		Fast low attack.
F + air:		Fast air attack.

L = LONG
L:				Fast long attack with longer recovery.
L + down:		Anti air attack.
L + air:		Bigger air attack.

S = STRONG
S:				Strong but slow attack.
S + down:		Launcher. Combos without using cancels.
S + air:		Spike attack.

Circle movements + attack: Special moves

<,v,> S:			20 frames High grounded attack.
>,v,< S:			20 frames Sweep low attack.

X:				Meter moves that costs meter.
<,v,> X:		Ultra move. Cost 100% meter.
X + Dash:		Force dash. Can be used in bad situations but ends combo and cost 25% meter.

Character stuff:

Balanced:	Batman, Katana

}

Claws{
	
}

	Heaven_F can jump high if you also press/hold A which is kinda wierd...
}

}

Dark ritual mage with a triangle{
	Slower dash but it is a teleport.
	
	Mine explodes on collision. Meaning you can dash through it.
	
	Has timed AoEs projectiled sprays and all kind of random shit.
	
	v>F = Create the circle. And dash forward. Cancelable.
	v<F = Create the circle. And dash backwards. Cancelable.
	<v>F = Circle implodes. Final.
	>v<F = Pull the circle in a slim line dealing good dmg and destroys the circle. Final.
	v>L = Slow moving star slightly upward that gravitate down. Explodes. Final.
	<v>L = Slow moving star straight forward. Explodes. Final.
	<vL = Slow moving star forward that gravitate up. Final.
	
	Has a burning shadow on ground that keeps on moving if you crouch. It deals small DoT
